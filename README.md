Welcome to Coplaner, an unofficial web application developed to assist Carleton University students in generating conflict-free timetables. As a Carleton University student myself, I understand the struggles of scheduling courses, which is why I created Coplaner. By simply providing a list of your courses, Coplaner will do its best to find all possible conflict-free timetables. It's my hope that Coplaner can save you time and frustration as you plan your terms. Thank you for using Coplaner, and I hope you find it useful!

## Disclaimer
Please note that the generated timetables are based on user-provided information and may not include all possible options. It is essential to review the generated timetables alongside the official university schedules for accuracy. I am not liable for any issues resulting from the use or reliance on Coplaner. Please keep in mind that Coplaner is a web application developed by a single individual, and it may have limitations or technical constraints. Your understanding and feedback are appreciated as I continually improve Coplaner's functionality. By using Coplaner, you agree to the above disclaimer and understand that the responsibility for course selections ultimately rests with you, the user.
